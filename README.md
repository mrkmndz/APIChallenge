APIChallenge
============

This is a fully functional and implemented iOS application that will run the tests for the CODE2040 API Challenge

The real important code is in APIChallenge/CODE2040iOS/ViewController.swift, the rest is mostly boilerplate to make the application infrastructure.

The Alamofire networking library was used to connect to the server

This is a picture of the UI I put together for the testing platform
